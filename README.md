# XamSpeak
XamSpeak allows you to take a photo of text and it will dictate it aloud!

## About
XamSpeak is an iOS and Android app that will dictate text from a photo. 

XamSpeak leverages Microsoft Cognitive Services to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Spell Check.


## ToDo
To access Microsoft's Coginitive Services Emotion API from this app, sign up for a [free API Key](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/) and insert it to the code [here](https://github.com/brminnick/XamSpeak/blob/master/XamSpeak/Constants/CognitiveServicesConstants.cs#L8). After adding your API Key, remove the diagnostic directive [located here](https://github.com/brminnick/XamSpeak/blob/master/XamSpeak/Constants/CognitiveServicesConstants.cs#L5).
